Now a days,we know that people need to work to earn money.As we know that,almost in all Foreign countries all the parents are working ,so they are unable to give proper attention to their kids.They keep a babysitter for caring their children.Sometimes some crictial conditions may occur like  parents  need to work for their livelihood .So parents assign a babysitter for caring of their children.So In this project,we will detect misbehaviour of babysitter with the help of  some MACHINE LEARNING algorithms and DEEP LEARNING techniques using JAVA-J2EE,PYTHON and ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE.We will set camera in their house where parents may not be at their home and misbehaviour of babysitter can be detected.If some misbehaviour attitude gets caught in Camera,then the notifications will be send to home owner and some neccessary actions will be taken against it by home owner.So violence of child activities can be reduced.
